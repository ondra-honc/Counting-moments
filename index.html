            <div class="panel coding"><h3>Coding</h3>
                <p>I like to turn logic into something beautiful, like this site. I want to make people happy with the work that I do. If you are interested I am more than willing to teach you something ;)</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="panel drifting"><h3>Drifting</h3>
                <p>I just started like 3 months ago, since I got a wheel, pedals and a stickshift since I can't have a real car yet, so I just enjoy simulation drifting. Don't think it's different in real life, you still need the same amout of control and focus + the E30 is my favorite car</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="panel k1"><h3>K-1</h3>
                <p>This is the thing that changed me. It's not always about the fight, but it's about the work you're willing to put in, K-1 taught me more about life than any textbook ever could. The guy in the background is my favorite fighter his name is Rodtang Jitmuangnon, just look at him, he's so sillyy </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="panel class"><h3>My Class</h3>
                <p>I also wanna introduce you to my autistic friends that I love, there aren't all of them. Don't mind the quality, it was taken on a nokia, since we thought it would be fun to use old phones instead of smartphones. You can take a guess who I am</p>

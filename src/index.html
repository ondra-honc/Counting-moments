            <div class="panel coding"><h3>Coding</h3>
                <p>I like to turn logic into something beatiful, like this site. I want to make people happy with the work that I do. If you are interested I am more than willing to teach you something ;)</p>

            <div class="panel drifting"><h3>Drifting</h3>
                <p>I just started like 3 months ago, since I got a wheel, pedals and a stickshift since I can't have a real car yet, so I just enjoy simulation drifting. Don't think it's different in real life, you still need the same amout of control and focus</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="panel k1"><h3>K-1</h3>
                <p>This is the thing that changed me. It's not always about the fight, but it's about the work you're willing to put in, K-1 taught me more about life than any textboor ever could. The guy in the background is my favorite fighter his name is, just look at him, he's so sillyy </p>

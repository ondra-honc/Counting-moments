             <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
                It started with a few words. I didn't plan on paying attention, but then I noticed the small things, the way you spoke, the way you listened. I'm a coder, I look for patterns. But you were a system I couldn't quite figure out yet.

             <h3 style="margin: 10px 0;">The Shift</h3>
             <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
                I usually joke about everything to keep things light, but the energy started to change. Talking to you wasn't just another task in my day, it became the reset button for my brain. Everything I was worried about, it all went quiet when you were around. I realized then: I wasn't just talking, I was waiting.

             <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
                People see the final product, but they don't see the hours in the dark. I spent nights staring at lines of code, trying to build a place that felt as right as our conversations. I know I'm 15, and I know what that looks like on paper. But hard work and honest feelings don't have a version number.

             <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
                I want you honestly. Not just as a witchy girl I talk to, but as the person I'm counting every moment for. I don't care if it's socially awkward or if the world thinks it's weird. I care that you're here, reading this. I'm dropping the act, the jokes, and the code. It's just me now. And I'm not going anywhere.
